# CVE-2023-6553

> Due to a incorrect include statement in the "Backup Migration" plugin, a attacker can achieve RCE

## Summary of the CVE

The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 via the /includes/backup-heart.php file. This is due to an attacker being able to control the values passed to an include, and subsequently leverage that to achieve remote code execution. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to easily execute code on the server.

## Affected Versions

- Backupbliss Backup Migration (Wordpress) <= 1.3.7

## Anomalies

- This exploit needs a php filter chain and is therefore using [php_filter_chain_generator](https://github.com/synacktiv/php_filter_chain_generator). You can download this the following ways:
    - If you haven't already cloned: `git clone https://github.com/cc3305/CVE-2023-6553 --recursive --shallow-submodules`.
    - Or if you have already cloned in, run this in the local git repo `git submodule update --init --depth 1`.
